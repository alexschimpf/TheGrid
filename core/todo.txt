Normal (basic):
 	- Meant to be built directly from XML
 	- Meant to be visible on the screen
 	- Have a sprite and body

Sensor (entity.sensor):
 	- Meant to be built directly from XML
 	- Not visible on screen
 	- Sprite is not used
 	- Body uses a sensor fixture
 	- Basically used to detect (and trigger a script) if a player enters a certain area
 	- Probably won't need to be extended
 	- The constructor takes a script id, size, position
 	- onBeginContact() executes the specified script
 	
Special (entity.special):
 	- Aren't meant to be built from the XML
 	- So far, just Player and PlayerShot
 	
Script
	- Has id you can reference in XML
	- Also meant to be executed by a sensor
	- A room has a map from script ids to script objects
	- Has update/done methods
	- Has onStart() method that can perform some logic ONCE when started
		- Additional things can be done in update()
