This game is a 2D platformer puzzle game. But it is different in that the mechanics are not very obvious 
and need to be learned as well. Typically, the mechanics are simple and obvious (or just totally explained), 
and it's just about applying them correctly. This game is about figuring everything out for yourself.
The rooms are intentionally small enough to where you can "feel" them out and learn how they work quickly.
In many games, the mechanics are familiar to the user. In this game, the mechanics are all arbitrary
and so need to be interacted with in order to understand. By allowing for unfamiliar mechanics, there is 
an infinite amount of room for creativity and expansion. But the game is also about timing and precision,
so just "solving the puzzle" is not enough. You have to be able to execute efficiently, too.

- Tutorial
	- Player starts in a small room with nothing.
	- Player is told to do certain things to help him learn the controls.
		- "Push A"... "What'd that do?"
		- "Hold A"... "You're learning"
		- "Push SPACE"... "Wow, you're powerful"
		- "Hold SPACE"... "Impressive"
	- When all are completed, a portal appears to bring the player to the first grid.
- Each room introduces a new entity.
- Each grid is 4 x 4.
- Each grid has a totally different looking environment.
	- This allows for a better sense of completion.
	- Also adds some diversity in the way things look.
	- And each grid will be small enough so that performance won't be an issue.
- Each grid should be somewhat unique (e.g. one may be more dynamic, or one may have "living" entities).
- Should feel continuous (between grids), not discrete and split up (like angry birds)

- Need a simple way to specify the border images, without all the border_overrides
- Need an elegant solution to the contiguous cracks problem
- Need to use a strong downward force on the player for vertical moving rectangles
- Need new game title
- Better menu
- Keep track of completion through each grid
- Can go back to any completed room in any world
- No room should get into a "stuck" state
	- "Restart room" button?
	- Rooms need to specify which openings are "enter" and which are "exit"
- Levels of difficulty
	- Basically just different sets of property values for each entity
